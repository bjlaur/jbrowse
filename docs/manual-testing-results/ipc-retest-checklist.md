## Round 1 — Initial Fixes

| # | Test | Harness | Manual | Why no harness? | Dev notes |
|---|------|---------|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| 1 | Open app, play an item — Now Playing page auto-shows | [x] | [x] | — | |
| 2 | Press `Space` — toggles pause, bottom bar updates | [x] | [x] | — | |
| 3 | Press `,` / `.` — seeks ±10s, position updates in bottom bar | [x] | [x] | — | |
| 4 | Press `Ctrl+B` — quality cycles, 3-second flash on Now Playing page | [x] | [ ] | — | **Needs server log check** — did it actually transcode? Video restarts (should be seamless). **FIX APPLIED**: seek back after loadfile_replace. |
| 5 | Press `Ctrl+P` — playback control menu appears (not Textual palette) | [x] | [ ] | — | **FAIL** — Textual palette still appears. Needs real-keyboard test. |
| 6 | Press `Ctrl+K` — stops playback via IPC | [x] | [x] | — | Pass. |
| 7 | Press `w` on info page — web URL overlay, any key closes | [x] | [ ] | — | **FAIL** — overlay overwritten by IPC refresh. **FIX APPLIED**: render_info() guards on _web_url_visible. |
| 8 | Press `w` on Now Playing page — overlay stays visible 3+ seconds | [x] | [ ] | — | **FAIL** — same as #7. **FIX APPLIED**: _render_now_playing() and _poll_info() skip when overlay visible. |
| 9 | Replace prompt wording: "Already playing" / "Play this instead?" / "Enter play  Backspace cancel" | [x] | [x] | — | Panel title: "Replace Playback". **FIX APPLIED**: text and title updated. |
| 10 | Press `y` on replace — new item plays, old session stops | [ ] | [x] | Didn't add a harness capture | Pass. |
| 11 | Press `n` on replace — cancel, returns to info page (not browser) | [x] | [ ] | — | **FIX APPLIED**: now returns to info. |
| 12 | Bottom bar shows `np: <title> – <MM:SS>` format | [x] | [x] | — | Pass. |
| 13 | Long filenames truncated to ~40 chars + SxxExx | [x] | [x] | — | Pass. |
| 14 | Info page Progress shows live IPC position (not cached) | [x] | [x] | — | Pass. |
| 15 | Info page Progress auto-updates without cursor movement | [ ] | [ ] | Didn't add a harness capture; timer-based refresh can't be verified in static SVG | **FAIL** — needs cursor movement. **FIX APPLIED**: added self.refresh() in poll. |
| 16 | Only one Progress line visible (no duplicate) | [x] | [ ] | — | **FIX APPLIED**: regex fixed from `Progress\s*:` to `Progress\s`. |
| 17 | Info page backspace → returns to browser | [x] | [x] | — | Pass. |
| 18 | Info → play → backspace from Now Playing → returns to info page | [x] | [x] | — | Pass. |
| 19 | Ctrl+G — mpv log works with line numbers | [x] | [x] | — | Pass. |
| 20 | MpV log scroll position indicator when scrollable | [x] | [ ] | — | User note: "it's a bar but was supposed to be textual scroll bar" — █░ doesn't render in SVG export. |

## Round 2 — New Re-test Requests

| # | Test | Harness | Manual | Why no harness? | Dev notes | Agent notes |
|---|------|---------|--------|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| 21 | Press Enter on replace prompt → starts playback | [x] | [ ] | — | **FIX APPLIED**: GUI text now shows "Enter play  Backspace cancel", panel title "Replace Playback". | Needs re-test. |
| 22 | Press Backspace on replace prompt → cancels, returns to info | [x] | [ ] | — | **FIX APPLIED**: Same as #21. | Needs re-test. |
| 23 | Press `n` on replace prompt → cancels, returns to info | [x] | [x] | — | Pass (although I did backspace) | — |
| 24 | Press `y` on replace → new item plays, old session stops | [ ] | [x] | Didn't add a harness capture | Pass (although I did enter) | — |
| 25 | Replace prompt wording: "Already playing" / "Play this instead?" / "Enter play  Backspace cancel" | [x] | [ ] | — | **FIX APPLIED**: Updated to "Enter play  Backspace cancel". | Needs re-test. |

| 27 | Info page Progress auto-updates without cursor movement | [x] | [ ] | — | **FIX APPLIED**: added self.refresh() in poll. | Needs re-test. |
| 28 | Only one Progress line visible (no duplicate) | [x] | [x] | — | **FIX APPLIED**: regex fixed. | — |
| 29 | Press `w` on info page → web URL overlay, stays visible | [x] | [ ] | — | **FIX APPLIED**: render_info() guards on _web_url_visible. | Needs re-test. |
| 30 | Press `w` on Now Playing page → overlay stays visible 3+ seconds | [x] | [x] | — | **FIX APPLIED**: _render_now_playing() and _poll_info() skip when overlay visible. | — |
| 31 | Press `w` → any key closes overlay | [x] | [x] | — | idk, I just did backspace that's good enough. | — |
| 32 | Press `Space` → toggles pause/play | [x] | [ ] | — | I already tested.. why am I being asked to test again. | Skip — carried over from round 1, already passed. |
| 33 | Press `,` → seeks -10s | [x] | [ ] | — | I already tested.. why am I being asked to test again. | Skip — carried over from round 1, already passed. |

| 35 | Press `Ctrl+B` → quality cycles, flash message | [x] | [x] | — | it works but.. Progress: 0:09 / 0:32. The progress is using the time from mpv instead of the time from jellyfin. Jump to time feature now exists (press `j` on Now Playing page). | **FIXED**: Jump to time overlay added with real IPC test. Progress display still uses mpv time-pos. | **FIXED**: Jump-to-time overlay, `j` key on Now Playing page. `--real-mpv-jump` test passes. |
| 36 | Press `Ctrl+B` → video does NOT restart (position preserved) | [x] | [x] | — | **FIX APPLIED**: seek back + `--real-mpv-bitrate` test added.

| 40 | Long filenames truncated to ~40 chars + SxxExx | [x] | [ ] | — | uhhhh can you give me a real world example so I can test this? And how do I test this? | Example: `Rick.and.Morty.S09E02.Ricks.Days.Seven.Nights.1080p.AMZN.WEB-DL.DDP5.1.H.264-Kitsune.mkv` → should show as `Rick and Morty – S09E02` in bottom bar. Test by playing any file with a long filename. |
| 41 | Bottom bar updates live with IPC position | [x] | [x] | — | needs cursor move to update. | **FIXED**: Added bottom bar poll timer that updates widget every second during playback. | **FIXED**: Bottom bar poll timer updates widget every second. |
| 42 | Info page backspace → returns to browser | [x] | [x] | — | | — |
| 43 | Info → play → backspace from Now Playing → returns to info | [x] | [x] | — | | — |
| 44 | Now Playing backspace → returns to previous page | [x] | [x] | — | | — |
| 45 | Ctrl+G → mpv log with line numbers | [x] | [ ] | — | why am I being asked to retest? | Skip — carried over from round 1, already passed. |
| 46 | MpV log scroll position indicator when scrollable | [x] | [ ] | — | add to todo to look into a better solution. | Will fix: add to TODO — █░ bar doesn't render in SVG, needs text-based indicator. |
| 47 | Open app, play item → Now Playing auto-shows | [x] | [x] | — | | — |

---

## Other Issues

- **Enter on same file**: If you press Enter on the same file you're already playing, it should just take you back to Now Playing page (not show replace prompt). **FIX APPLIED**: `start_playback()` now checks if item ID matches current and opens Now Playing directly.
