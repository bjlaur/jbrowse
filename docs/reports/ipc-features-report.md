# IPC Features Implementation Report

**Branch**: `ipc-features`
**Date**: 2026-06-22
**Status**: All 6 phases complete + playback control menu + screenshot harness updates

---

## Summary

Implemented a complete mpv IPC (Inter-Process Communication) layer and 6 feature phases on top of it, transforming jbrowse from a basic mpv launcher into a full-featured Jellyfin TUI with accurate playback reporting, live progress tracking, quality controls, and a Now Playing page. Also added a global playback control menu, comprehensive screenshot harness coverage, and a release checklist.

## Phase-by-Phase Details

### Phase 1: Low-Level IPC Layer
**Commit**: `51bfb24`

- `PlaybackManager` connects to mpv via `--input-ipc-server` Unix socket
- Socket connect with retry, JSON command/response with request_id matching
- Public API: `ipc_get_property`, `ipc_set_property`, `ipc_command`
- High-level helpers: `toggle_pause`, `seek_to`, `seek_relative`, `loadfile_replace`, `set_track`, `stop_via_ipc`
- `stop_active()` tries IPC `stop` first, falls back to `terminate()`
- `--ipc-only` and `--play-duration` flags on screenshot harness

### Phase 2: Accurate Jellyfin Playback Reporting
**Commit**: `f37d1ea`

- `position_ticks()` uses IPC `time-pos` first, falls back to wall-clock
- Periodic progress reporter thread sends `/Sessions/Playing/Progress` every 5s
- `playback_payload()` reads `pause` state from IPC
- Bottom status bar shows live state with position
- Verified server-side: all Jellyfin reports accepted with accurate positions

### Phase 3: Replace-Current-Playback Prompt
**Commit**: `7b391b0`

- Confirmation overlay when playing over active playback
- Shows current + replacement item, `y replace | n cancel`
- On confirm: stops old Jellyfin session, uses IPC `loadfile_replace`

### Phase 4: Pause/Stop/Seek Controls
**Commit**: `2568d1e`

- `Space` toggles pause/play via IPC
- `,` / `.` seek -10s / +10s via IPC
- Help page updated

### Phase 5: Now Playing Page
**Commit**: (in `c3b1bff`)

- New `now_playing` page, opened with `Ctrl+N`
- Progress bar with `█░` blocks, position/duration from IPC
- Track info from IPC `track-list`, quality label
- 1-second polling timer, auto-returns to browser on playback end

### Phase 6: Static Bitrate Selection
**Commit**: `c3b1bff`

- `[playback]` config section with `quality_presets` and `default_quality`
- `Ctrl+B` cycles quality presets
- Uses `loadfile_replace` with transcoding URL for seamless quality change

### Playback Control Menu (Ctrl+P)
**Commit**: `c3b1bff`

- Global overlay accessible from any page
- Shows playback state, position/duration, quality
- Key actions: Space pause, `,`/`. seek, Ctrl+B quality, Ctrl+K stop, Ctrl+N now playing

## Screenshot Harness Updates

**Commit**: `3297e68`

### New Captures Added
- `now-playing.svg` — Now Playing page with progress bar, track info, quality
- `playback-control.svg` — Ctrl+P menu with all playback controls
- `replace-prompt.svg` — Replace confirmation overlay

### Total Captures: 11
browser, after-ctrl-x, search, info, subtitles, help, mpv-log, refreshing, now-playing, playback-control, replace-prompt

### New `--view` Flag
Run a single capture for fast iteration:
```bash
python tools/svg_screenshot_poc.py --view now-playing
python tools/svg_screenshot_poc.py --view replace-prompt
python tools/svg_screenshot_poc.py --view playback-control
```

### Fake Playback Infrastructure
- `_setup_fake_playback()` — sets up PlaybackManager with fake active playback
- `_FakeProcess` — fake subprocess that reports as "running"
- `_FakeIpcSock` — fake IPC socket
- `_FAKE_IPC_VALUES` — plausible property values (time-pos, duration, pause, track-list)

## Testing Summary

All tests passed on every phase:

- **Compile**: `python -m py_compile jbrowse.py tools/svg_screenshot_poc.py` — clean
- **Screenshots**: `python tools/svg_screenshot_poc.py --item otter` — 11/11 pass
- **IPC smoke**: `python tools/svg_screenshot_poc.py --ipc-only --real --play-duration 5` — time-pos ≈ elapsed ✅
- **Server-side**: Verified Jellyfin reports accepted in playback log ✅
- **Single capture**: `--view now-playing`, `--view replace-prompt`, `--view playback-control` all work ✅

## Known Gaps / Manual Release Check Items

1. Play an item, press `Ctrl+N` — Now Playing page shows live progress bar
2. Press `Space` — toggles pause, bottom bar state updates
3. Press `,` / `.` — seeks ±10s, position updates
4. Press `Ctrl+B` — quality cycles, status message shown
5. Press `Ctrl+P` — playback control menu appears
6. Play item, navigate to another, press Enter — replace prompt appears
7. Press `y` — new item starts, old session stopped
8. Press `Ctrl+G` during playback — mpv log page works
9. Press `Ctrl+K` — stops playback via IPC
10. **Bottom bar progress bar** — needs manual review (text-only for now, TODO item added)

---

## What's Next (from TODO.md)

1. Bottom bar progress bar (after manual review)
2. Server-side safety guard
3. Audio picker
4. Better help text / key map cleanup
5. Split into modules (later)
6. Build/packaging/Arch PKGBUILD
